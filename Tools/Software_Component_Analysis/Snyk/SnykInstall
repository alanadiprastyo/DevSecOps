Download the source code

We will do all the exercises locally first in DevSecOps-Box, so lets start the exercise.

First, we need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.

git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv webapp

Lets cd into the application code so we can scan the app.

cd webapp

We are now in the webapp directory.



Install Synk Tool

    Dependency analysis tool or SCA is used to find vulnerabilities in open source dependencies and it supports multiple programming languages such as Ruby, Python, NodeJS, Java, Go, .NET. It’s easy to use, a developer can use it on his/her machine using the command line or DevOps team can embed it into CI/CD pipeline.

    Source: Snyk

    You can find more details about the project at https://github.com/snyk/snyk

Let’s download the Snyk Linux utility.

wget -O snyk https://github.com/snyk/snyk/releases/download/v1.388.0/snyk-linux

Give executable permission to the snyk binary and move it to /usr/local/bin/ directory.

chmod +x snyk

mv snyk /usr/local/bin/

Let’s explore what options Snyk provides us.

snyk --help

Usage:

  $ snyk [command] [options] [package]

The package argument is optional. If no package is given, Snyk will
run the command against the current working directory allowing you
to test your non-public applications.

Commands:

  auth [api-token] ... Authenticate use of the Snyk CLI tool with your Snyk account.
  test ............... Test for any known vulnerabilities.
  wizard ............. Configure your policy file to update, auto patch and
                       ignore vulnerabilities in npm & yarn projects. snyk wizard updates your .snyk file automatically.
  protect ............ Protect your code from vulnerabilities and
                       optionally suppress specific vulnerabilities.
                       Note: Node.js only.
  monitor ............ Record the state of dependencies and any
                       vulnerabilities on snyk.io.
  policy ............. Display the .snyk policy for a package.
  ignore ............. Modifies the .snyk policy to ignore stated issues.
                       For more information run `snyk help ignore`.
  help [topic] ....... Display this detailed help about commands and options.
  config ............. Manage Snyk's configuration, note that this configuration is stored
                       on your machine and applies to all Snyk CLI calls.

Options:

  --all-projects ..... (test & monitor commands only)
                       Auto detect all projects in working directory.
  --detection-depth=<number>
                       (test & monitor commands only)
                       Use with --all-projects or --yarn-workspaces to indicate how many sub-directories to search.
                       Defaults to 4 (the current working directory and three sub-directories).
  --exclude=<comma separated list of directory names>
                       (test & monitor commands only)
                       Can be used with --all-projects and --yarn-workspaces to indicate sub-directories to exclude.
                       Directories must be comma separated.
                       If using with --detection-depth exclude ignores directories at any level deep.
  --dev .............. Include devDependencies (defaults to production only).
  --file=<File> ...... Sets package file. For more help run `snyk help file`.
  --org=<org-name> ... Specify the org machine-name to run Snyk with a specific
                       organization. For more help run `snyk help orgs`.
  --ignore-policy .... Ignores the current policy in .snyk file, org level ignores and project policy on snyk.io.
  --trust-policies ... Applies and uses ignore rules from your dependencies'
                       Snyk policies, otherwise ignore policies are only
                       shown as a suggestion.
  --show-vulnerable-paths=<none|some|all>
                       (test command only)
                       Display the dependency paths from the top level
                       dependencies, down to the vulnerable packages.
                       Defaults to "some" (a few example paths).
                       "false" is an alias for "none".
                       Doesn't affect output in JSON mode.
  --project-name=<string>
                       Specify a custom Snyk project name.
  --policy-path ...... Manually pass a path to a snyk policy file.

                       Prune dependency trees, removing duplicate sub-dependencies.
                       Will still find all vulnerabilities, but potentially not all
                       of the vulnerable paths.
  --remote-repo-url=<string>
                       (monitor command only)
                       Set or override the remote URL for the repository that you would like to monitor.
  --fail-on=<all|upgradable|patchable>
                       Only fail when there are vulnerabilities that can be fixed.
                       All fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be either upgraded or patched.
                       Upgradable fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be upgraded.
                       Patchable fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be patched.
                       If vulnerabilities do not have a fix and this option is being used tests will pass.
  --json-file-output=<string>
                       (test command only)
                       Save test output in JSON format directly to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--json` option.
                       This is especially useful if you want to display the human-readable test output via stdout and at the same time save the JSON format output to a file.

Maven options:
  --scan-all-unmanaged
                       Auto detects maven jars and wars in given directory.
                       Individual testing can be done with --file=<jar-file-name>

                       functions and packages are called.
  --reachable-timeout=<number>
                       (test and monitor commands only)
                       The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for Snyk
                       to gather reachability data. If it takes longer than
                       the specified interval, Reachable Vulnerabilities are
                       not reported. This does not affect regular test or
                       monitor output.
                       Defaults to waiting 300s (5 minutes).

Gradle options:
  --sub-project=<string> (alias: --gradle-sub-project)
                       For Gradle "multi project" configurations,
                       test a specific sub-project.
  --all-sub-projects   For "multi project" configurations, test all
                       sub-projects.
  --configuration-matching=<string>
                       Resolve dependencies using only configuration(s) that
                       match the provided Java regular expression, e.g.
                       '^releaseRuntimeClasspath$'.
  --configuration-attributes=<string>
                       Select certain values of configuration attributes to
                       resolve the dependencies. E.g.:
                       'buildtype:release,usage:java-runtime'

.Net (Nuget) options:
  --assets-project-name
                       When monitoring a .NET project using NuGet
                       PackageReference use the project name in
                       project.assets.json, if found.
  --packages-folder    Custom path to packages folder

npm options:
  --strict-out-of-sync=<true|false>

                       Prevent testing out of sync lockfiles. Defaults to true.
  --yarn-workspaces    (test and monitor command only)
                       Detect and scan yarn workspaces. You can specify how many sub-directories to search using --detection-depth and exclude directories using --exclude.


CocoaPods options:
  --strict-out-of-sync=<true|false>
                       Prevent testing out of sync lockfiles. Defaults to false.

Python options:
  --command=<string>   Indicate which specific Python commands to use based on Python version.
                       The default is 'python' which executes your systems default python version.
                       Run 'python -V' to find out what version that is.
                       If you are using multiple Python versions, use this parameter to specify the correct Python command for execution.
                       For example: `--command=python3`.
  --skip-unresolved=<true|false>
                       Allow skipping packages that are not found
                       in the environment.

Docker options:
  --docker (alias: --container)
                       Test or monitor a local Docker image for Linux vulnerabilities.
  --file=<string> .... Include the path to the image's Dockerfile for more detailed
                       remediation advice.
  --exclude-base-image-vulns
                       Exclude from display Docker base image vulnerabilities.

Examples:

  $ snyk test
  $ snyk test ionic@1.6.5
  $ snyk test --show-vulnerable-paths=false
  $ snyk monitor --org=my-team
  $ snyk monitor --project-name=my-project
  $ snyk test --docker ubuntu:18.04 --org=my-team
  $ snyk test --docker app:latest --file=Dockerfile --policy-path=path/to/.snyk
  $ snyk test --yarn-workspaces  --detection-depth=4 --strict-out-of-sync=false


Possible exit statuses and their meaning:

  - 0: success, no vulns found
  - 1: action_needed, vulns found
  - 2: failure, try to re-run command

Pro tip: use `snyk test` in your test scripts, if a vulnerability is
found, the process will exit with a non-zero exit code.

Let’s move to the next step.



Run the Scanner

As we have learned in the DevSecOps Gospel, we should save the output in a machine-readable format.

We are using –json argument to output the results in JSON format.

snyk test --json /webapp

issingApiTokenError: `snyk` requires an authenticated account. Please run `snyk auth` and try again.
    at Object.apiTokenExists (/snapshot/snyk/dist/lib/api-token.js:19:15)

    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:984:32)
    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:877:14)

We are greeted with an error. Snyk is complaining about missing API Token as its a paid solution and want you to register before it can run the scan.

If you haven’t registered before, you can go to Snyk website and click SIGN UP FOR FREE -> Select Google account options -> Complete sign up -> Select CLI and go to the account settings page https://app.snyk.io/account and copy the token.

Once you have the token, you can authenticate to the Snyk service using snyk auth command.

snyk auth YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE

Your account has been authenticated. Snyk is now ready to be used.

or you can also export the environment variable using the following command.

export SNYK_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

Now that we are authenticated, we can now start to scan our code with snyk test command.

snyk test --json /webapp

{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Missing node_modules folder: we can't test without dependencies.\nPlease run 'npm install' first.",
  "path": "/webapp/"
}

But it raises another error, we need to install the dependencies using npm install.

npm install

    Why do we need to install it though? we didn’t do this with the safety tool.

Oops, one more error. Looks like we do not have npm installed. Let’s go ahead and install it using the following commands.

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash -

apt install nodejs -y

    Ensure you are in the /webapp directory. If not, please use cd webapp to change the directory.

Let’s re-run npm install command.

npm install

Finally, run the scan and save the output in a file.

snyk test --json /webapp > output.json

phew! that was definitely not easy.

No
