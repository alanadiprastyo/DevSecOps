Download the source code

We will do all the exercises locally first in DevSecOps-Box, so lets start the exercise.

First, We need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.

git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/rails.git webapp

Lets cd into the application so we can scan the app.

cd webapp

We are now in the webapp directory.

Let’s move to the next step.



Install the bundler-audit tool

Basically, our system doesn’t have Ruby installed, so we need to install it using rbenv utility so lets install rbenv.

curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-installer | bash

Running doctor script to verify installation...
Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: not found
  You seem to have rbenv installed in `/root/.rbenv/bin', but that
  directory is not present in PATH. Please add it to PATH by configuring
  your `~/.bashrc', `~/.zshrc', or `~/.config/fish/config.fish'.

The rbenv utility is complaining about not being on the path, so lets add it to the path using the following command.

export PATH="~/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"

Before we install ruby, lets check what version of ruby our project needs by peeking into Gemfile

cat Gemfile

# frozen_string_literal: true
source "https://rubygems.org"

#don't upgrade
gem "rails", "6.0.0"

ruby "2.6.5"

Okay, it seems we need to use ruby “2.6.5”. Let’s go ahead and install it using rbenv

rbenv install 2.6.5

Let’s try installing ruby again

rbenv install --verbose 2.6.5

We need to ruby on the path

export PATH="/root/.rbenv/versions/2.6.5/bin:$PATH"

Okay, its done. Now, we can verify the ruby version using the following command
ruby --version

ruby 2.6.5p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x86_64-linux]

Let’s install the bundler-audit tool to perform SCA.

gem install --user-install bundler-audit

We will add the tool to the PATH, so we can refer it on the command line.

export PATH="~/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin/:$PATH"

We have successfully installed bundler-audit, let’s move to the next step.



Run the OAST/SCA Scan

The idea here is to show you that the tools are not perfect, installation steps might break and even simple things won’t work in a predictable manner.

Let’s perform the SCA scan on our code with the following command.

Vulnerabilities found!

As you can see there are several vulnerabilities in our Rails application.
Exercise:

    Use appropriate bundler-audit options/flags to satisfy all requirements of DevSecOps Gospel.
    Share the command with the staff once done.
