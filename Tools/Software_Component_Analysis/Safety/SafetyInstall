Download the source code

We will do all the exercises locally first in DevSecOps-Box, so lets start the exercise.

First, we need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.

git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv webapp

Lets cd into the application code, so we can scan the app.

cd webapp

We are now in the webapp directory.



Install Safety Tool

    Safety checks your installed dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.

    By default, it uses the open Python vulnerability database Safety DB but can be upgraded to use pyup.io’s Safety API using the –key option.

    Source: Safety Website

    You can find more details about the project at https://github.com/pyupio/safety

Let’s install the safety tool on the system to scan the python dependencies.

pip3 install safety

Lets explore what options safety provides us.

safety check --help


Usage: safety check [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --key TEXT                      API Key for pyup.io's vulnerability
                                  database. Can be set as SAFETY_API_KEY
                                  environment variable. Default: empty

                                  Default: --no-json

  --full-report / --short-report  Full reports include a security advisory (if
                                  available). Default: --short-report

  --bare / --not-bare             Output vulnerable packages only. Useful in
                                  combination with other tools.Default: --not-
                                  bare

  --cache / --no-cache            Cache requests to the vulnerability database
                                  locally. Default: --no-cache

  --stdin / --no-stdin            Read input from stdin. Default: --no-stdin
  -r, --file FILENAME             Read input from one (or multiple)
                                  requirement files. Default: empty

  -i, --ignore TEXT               Ignore one (or multiple) vulnerabilities by
                                  ID. Default: empty

  -o, --output TEXT               Path to where output file will be placed.

  -pr, --proxy-protocol TEXT      Proxy protocol (https or http) --proxy-
                                  protocol

  --help                          Show this message and exit.

Let’s move to the next step.


Run the Scanner

As we have learned in the DevSecOps Gospel we should save the output in a machine-readable format.

We are using tee command to show the output and store it a file simultaneously

safety check -r requirements.txt --json | tee safety_output.json

    -r flag used to specify the input file.
    --json flag tells that output should be in the JSON format.

As you can see, we found considerable security issues in third party components.
